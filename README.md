# COVID-19 Detector
The novel Coronavirus also called COVID-19 has now spread across the world.As the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing shortage of testing kits and resources. AI is already transforming many different fields.The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged me to come up with a deep learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays.

I applied a CNN Model, which I had trained on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset containing Chest X-Rays, for detecting COVID-19 & achieved 96% accuracy on the validation set with respective to Radiologist's clinical findings.
